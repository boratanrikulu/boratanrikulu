Hey there,

I’m Bora, a software engineer based in Izmir, Turkey.  
Currently working at [Sematext](https://sematext.com), where I focus on building observability and monitoring tools.  
My work centers on developing the Sematext Agent, a tool designed to collect and monitor data across systems. I specialize in Go, with a strong interest in Linux, Networking, Kubernetes, and eBPF, and I’m always exploring new technologies to bring fresh, innovative approaches to my projects.

Feel free to explore my site [bora.sh](https://bora.sh) to learn more about me.  
If you have any questions or want to connect, don’t hesitate to reach out at [me@bora.sh](mailto:me@bora.sh).
